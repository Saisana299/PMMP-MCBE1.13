/**
 * Class used to run async tasks in other threads.
 *
 * An AsyncTask does not have its own thread. It is queued into an AsyncPool and executed if there is an async worker
 * with no AsyncTask running. Therefore, an AsyncTask SHOULD NOT execute for more than a few seconds. For tasks that
 * run for a long time or infinitely, start another thread instead.
 *
 * WARNING: Any non-Threaded objects WILL BE SERIALIZED when assigned to members of AsyncTasks or other Threaded object.
 * If later accessed from said Threaded object, you will be operating on a COPY OF THE OBJECT, NOT THE ORIGINAL OBJECT.
 * If you want to store non-serializable objects to access when the task completes, store them using
 * {@link AsyncTask::storeLocal}.
 *
 * WARNING: As of pthreads v3.1.6, arrays are converted to Volatile objects when assigned as members of Threaded objects.
 * Keep this in mind when using arrays stored as members of your AsyncTask.
 *
 * WARNING: Do not call PocketMine-MP API methods from other Threads!!
